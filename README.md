# setting up our project:
- clone the project
- cd into the client folder
- run “npm install”

# important:
- please make use of reusable components: such as Button, ProductCard….
- For colors I’ve already setup the color variables inside the tailwind config EX: to get the first color just type text-primary….
-> this keeps consistency between the styling and makes it easier for everyone to reuse common components in our website

# state management with pinia
- We will use pinia store for state management that is located inside ./stores folder
- I have provided some demo already inside the store

# component library:
- we will use prime vue for component library: -> https://primevue.org/

# routing?
- I have already setup the router, if u have to create a new page for that, just create a new file inside ./views and register the route within the page inside ./router/index.js
